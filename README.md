Third Task of Data Analyst Internship @ Elevate Labs

Steps to Create the Dashboard in Power BI

1.Imported Data

Loaded the dataset (EV registrations/vehicle details) into Power BI from Excel/CSV.

2.Data Cleaning & Preparation

Checked column headers (State, Vehicle Type, Manufacturer, CAFV Eligibility, etc.).

Handled missing/blank data by replacing or filtering them.

Ensured correct data types (e.g., numeric for counts, text for state names).

3.Created Visuals for Insights

Map Chart – Showed total vehicles by U.S. states with color intensity (lighter → darker green).

Bar/Column Charts – Displayed vehicle count by manufacturer, CAFV eligibility, and top models.

Line Chart – Tracked EV adoption over time (growth trend).

Pie/Donut Chart – Showed distribution of vehicle types or fuel eligibility.

4.Formatting & Customization

Applied a consistent color theme (greens for map, blues/oranges for other visuals).

Used labels, legends, and titles to make visuals clear.

Adjusted borders, transparency, and background for better readability.

5.Dashboard Layout

Arranged visuals logically:

Map on top for geographic overview.

Charts below for manufacturer, eligibility, and model analysis.

Trend line chart for adoption over time.

Ensured a balanced and clean layout.

6.Final Touches

Added slicers/filters (e.g., by state or vehicle type) for interactivity.

Verified accuracy of totals and percentages.

Published/Exported the dashboard for presentation.
